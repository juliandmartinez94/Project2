# Project2

a. Introduction: Introduce your web app and its purpose.
Project 2 for CAP 4104. Used Open Brewery DB as an API to show users the breweries in every state. 

b. Usability goals: Describe the usability goals you set for your web app and explain how you addressed each goal.
I used a sidebar from which the user can select a state and choose brewery type to locate breweries in a specific area. 

c. Design process: Discuss your design process, from sketching to implementation.
Tried to keep the interface simple and clean. Used the color of beer (deep orange) to bring some creativity to the graphs. Tried to include the most important information at the 
top of the of the page (table, map, etc.) so its easier for the user to locate useful data. 

d. API integration: Explain how you utilized the APIs and discuss any challenges or limitations encountered.
I looked for an API that did not require any credentials and was open sourced to the public domain. I went on Open Brewery DB and used the API documentation
to poulate the data on my web app. 

e. Interactive widgets: Describe the widgets you incorporated and their purposes.
Hideable sidebar, dropdown for the states, check box list for the filters, interatcive table for the list of breweries, map with a check box that allows user to hide the widget, 
slidebar for the amount of results the user wants to have displayed, bar graph and line graph for the number of breweries in the area. There is also a success display box when the user fetches the data as well as a loading display box  

f. HCI design principles:
My app allows the user to know how their actions affect the web app. Once a list of breweries is fetched the user will see a success display box. The widgets allow for immediate feedback, any changes made are automatically displayed in the charts, graphs, and map. There is a uniform lay out for every slection the user makes and the 
web page is intuitive with clear instructions. 


h. Conclusion: Reflect on your experience and discuss potential future improvements.
I would like to learn some design elements that would allow me to incorporate my own graphics into the web app. 
Using emojis as quick deign idea may be fun but also elementry to the graphics that exists. Learning how to 
use API that have credentials like Spotify would be interestng to learn in the future.
